    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently a student attending Florida State University who is graduating in the summer of 2015 (hire me!). I love working on interesting projects either in my free-time or freelance. I am currently very interested in pursuing a career in web design/development. 
     </p>
     <p>
      What's important to me is to always keep learning. The internet is constantly evolving and changing and I am constantly striving to stay on top of it all!
